**🌟 JSSOne – Your Campus, Simplified 🏫**
This is the repository for my submission for the NCS Convergex Hackathon 2024. 

🚀 JSSOne is your one-stop solution for managing and accessing all campus activities, updates, and trends at JSSATEN. Whether you're a student, a CR, or a club secretary, JSSOne keeps you informed, connected, and engaged with everything happening in the heart of our campus life.

**🔍 Why JSSOne?**
